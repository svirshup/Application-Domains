# Application-Domains
This repo contains class assignments for the UC Davis MSBA course on Application Domains. While this class is not primarily related to coding, some assignments may require me to upload material here, and I might save notebooks here while working on my own.

Right now, this repo contains just one assignment, which is on marketing attribution. At the time of writing this, the notebook is still being worked on. This is the assignment:

The analysis should consist of the following sections: 

* Description of input data variables. Your observations on patterns and trends in the input data, and any takeaways you may have on the input data. If you can apply some of the concepts around trade promotions, consumer promotions and media in your takeways, then it would elevate the overall quality of analysis.
* Estbalish a model that relates an outcome variable like sales units to other input variables. Please explain the reasoning you have used to define the model, and the method you have chosen to estimate your model.
* Describe whether your model makes sense, and how you can enable decision making for a marketing manager using your model. Describe the validity of your model, and constraints associated with the model.

I will continue to update this README throughout this course, and when new content is uploaded.
